# Coverage Support Added! 🎯

## New HTML Coverage Features

### Make Targets Added:
- `make coverage` - Run tests with coverage (text report)
- `make coverage-html` - Generate HTML coverage report in htmlcov/
- `make coverage-browse` - Generate HTML report and open in browser

### HTML Reports Provide:
- 📊 **Interactive line-by-line coverage visualization**
- 🎯 **Class and function coverage breakdown**  
- 📈 **Overall project coverage metrics**
- 🔍 **Easy identification of untested code paths**
- 🌐 **Cross-platform browser support** (xdg-open, firefox, chrome, etc.)

### Current Coverage Status:
- **Total Coverage**: **86%** (target: 90%)
- **ydmenu.py**: 86% coverage (738 statements, 105 missed)
- **setup.py**: 87% coverage (245 statements, 32 missed)
- **Test Count**: 98 comprehensive tests

### Configuration:
- **.coveragerc**: Automatically excludes test files and virtual environment
- **HTML Output**: Reports saved to htmlcov/ directory (auto-ignored by git)
- **Browser Integration**: Automatic opening with cross-platform fallbacks

### Usage Examples:
```bash
# Quick text coverage report
make coverage

# Generate and view HTML report
make coverage-browse

# Development workflow  
make test && make coverage-html && make lint
```

### Session Achievements:
